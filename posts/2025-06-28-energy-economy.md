In EvoSim, energy is not just a resource; it is the very essence of existence, the currency of life, and the primary driver of natural selection. Every single action a creature takes, from the most basic movement to the complex process of reproduction, comes with an energy cost. Understanding this intricate energy economy is absolutely crucial to appreciating the profound evolutionary pressures that shape the digital life forms within your simulator.

### Energy Acquisition: The Lifeline of Species

Creatures in EvoSim primarily acquire energy through two fundamental mechanisms:

1.  **Consumption of Meat:** This is the most direct way for mobile species to gain energy. When a creature with `consumption` cells encounters a `Meat` object, it consumes it, instantly gaining energy. The amount of energy gained is determined by the `meat_energy_value` and `green_meat_energy_value` settings. These values can be tweaked to make food more or less abundant, directly impacting survival rates and competition.

2.  **Absorption via Roots:** For species that have evolved `roots` cells, energy can be absorbed directly from the terrain. This is a more passive, but potentially very stable, form of energy gain. The `plant_energy_absorption_rate_per_cell_per_second` setting, combined with the number of `roots` cells a creature possesses, dictates the rate of absorption. Furthermore, the type of terrain (e.g., `saturated_dirt` vs. `dirt`) can provide a `gain_multiplier_from_terrain`, making certain areas more fertile and desirable for rooted species. This introduces a spatial element to energy acquisition, encouraging different evolutionary strategies based on environmental conditions.

### Energy Expenditure: The Cost of Living

Life in EvoSim is expensive. Energy is constantly being drained to maintain the creature's very existence and to perform actions. Key expenditure categories include:

1.  **Base Maintenance Cost:** Even doing nothing costs energy. The `base_maintenance_cost` setting represents the fundamental metabolic rate required to keep a species alive. This ensures that creatures cannot simply exist indefinitely without actively acquiring resources.

2.  **Cell-Specific Maintenance Costs:** Each specialized cell type comes with its own ongoing energy drain, defined in the `cell_maintenance_costs` dictionary. For instance:
    *   `movement` cells: Cost energy even when idle, reflecting the metabolic overhead of having locomotion capabilities.
    *   `consumption` cells: Have a small cost, representing the biological machinery for digestion.
    *   `luminescence` cells: Can be very energy-intensive, reflecting the high cost of producing light.
    *   `eyes` and `brain` cells: Crucial for sensory input and decision-making, but come with their own significant energy demands, reflecting the biological cost of complex neural structures.
    *   `attack` cells: Require energy to maintain, even when not actively attacking, representing the readiness for combat.

3.  **Movement Costs:** Beyond maintenance, actual movement consumes energy based on velocity. The `movement_cost_rate_per_velocity` setting scales this cost. Faster movement means a higher energy burn, forcing a trade-off between speed and energy conservation. This directly influences how far species can travel to find food or escape predators.

4.  **Reproduction Costs:** The ultimate goal of evolution is reproduction, but it's not free. The `child_energy_split_ratio` setting determines how much energy a parent transfers to its offspring, and the parent also incurs a `reproduction_cooldown` period. This ensures that reproduction is a strategic decision, requiring sufficient energy reserves and a recovery period.

5.  **Attack Costs:** Engaging in combat is energy-intensive. `energy_drain_per_attack_cell_per_second` and `attack_maintenance_cost_per_second` dictate the energy cost of attacking and maintaining attack capabilities. Successful attacks can yield energy from the defeated opponent (`attack_energy_gain_ratio`), creating a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

### The Evolutionary Impact

The constant interplay between energy intake and expenditure is the crucible of evolution in EvoSim. Species that can efficiently acquire energy, minimize waste, and strategically spend their reserves are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their advantageous traits. This relentless struggle for energy drives the development of diverse cellular structures, behavioral patterns (like `hunter`, `sporadic`, `stationary`), and life strategies. By tweaking these energy-related settings, you can dramatically alter the evolutionary landscape, encouraging the emergence of new adaptations and observing the fascinating ways digital life finds to thrive.
