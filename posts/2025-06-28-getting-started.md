Welcome, aspiring evolutionary biologist, to EvoSim! This guide is designed to get you up and running with your very first simulation, allowing you to quickly dive into the fascinating world of digital evolution. While the simulator boasts a rich array of configurable settings and complex underlying mechanics, the initial steps to launch and observe are straightforward and accessible.

### Step 1: Acquiring the Simulator

Before you can witness evolution in action, you need the EvoSim Python script. Head over to the dedicated [Download page](/download) on this very website. There, you'll find the latest `EvoSim.py` file. Ensure you download it to a location on your computer where you can easily find it.

**Prerequisites:**

To run EvoSim, your system needs to meet a few basic requirements:

*   **Python 3.x:** EvoSim is built with Python. If you don't have it installed, you can download the latest version from the official Python website ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)). During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" for easier command-line access.
*   **Pygame Library:** EvoSim uses Pygame for its graphical interface. Once Python is installed, you can install Pygame by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
    This command will download and install the necessary Pygame modules.

### Step 2: Launching Your First Simulation

Once you have `EvoSim.py` and Pygame installed, you're ready to launch:

1.  **Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `EvoSim.py`.
    *   On Windows, you can often right-click in the folder and select "Open in Terminal" or "Open PowerShell window here."
    *   Alternatively, use the `cd` command (e.g., `cd C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads`).
2.  **Run the Script:** Execute the simulator using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python EvoSim.py
    ```
3.  **The Main Menu:** A new window will appear, presenting you with the EvoSim main menu. For your very first experience, the simplest path is to click the prominent "Start Simulation" button. This will launch a simulation with the default settings, which are well-balanced for initial observation.

### Step 3: Observing and Interacting

The simulation window will now display a vibrant world teeming with small, colorful creatures. Initially, their movements might appear random, but as the simulation progresses over time, you'll begin to discern patterns, observe interactions, and witness the subtle yet profound effects of evolutionary pressures.

**Basic Controls to Get You Started:**

*   **Camera Panning:** Click and drag your mouse anywhere on the simulation world to pan the camera and explore different regions of the environment.
*   **Zooming:** Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Zooming allows you to get a closer look at individual species and their cellular structures, or to zoom out and observe large-scale population dynamics.
*   **Time Rate Slider:** In the top-left corner of the screen, you'll find a time rate slider. You can drag this slider to speed up or slow down the simulation. This is incredibly useful for fast-forwarding through periods of less activity or slowing down to closely observe critical evolutionary events.
*   **In-Game Settings Menu:** Press the **'M' key** (for Menu) at any time during the simulation to open the in-game settings panel. While it's recommended to just observe for your first run, this menu is where you can later fine-tune every aspect of the simulation, from energy costs to mutation rates.

### What to Expect and How to Learn

Don't be afraid to simply watch and let the simulation unfold. The true beauty of EvoSim lies in the emergent complexity that arises from a relatively simple set of rules. Pay attention to:

*   **Population Fluctuations:** How do species numbers change over time? Do some lineages die out while others thrive?
*   **Behavioral Shifts:** Do you notice species changing their primary behaviors (e.g., from foraging to hunting)?
*   **Cellular Adaptations:** As you zoom in, can you see changes in the cellular composition of successful species over generations?

This first run is your introduction to the dynamic world of artificial evolution. Enjoy your initial step into this captivating realm, and prepare to be amazed by the digital life you help create!
